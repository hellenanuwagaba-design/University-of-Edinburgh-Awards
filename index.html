        <h2>Digital Skills Specialists Edinburgh Award</h2>
      <p>
        The Digital Skills Specialists Edinburgh Award is designed to help students develop and showcase their digital skills while making a real impact. Running from October to March, the program guides participants through identifying the skills they want to improve, developing them through workshops and self-directed learning, and applying them in a practical project. Students take part in mandatory group sessions, complete 16 hours of self-directed learning, attend workshops, and carry out a project that demonstrates their new skills.
