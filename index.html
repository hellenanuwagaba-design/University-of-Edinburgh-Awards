      <h2>Digital Skills Specialists Edinburgh Award</h2>
      <p>
        The Digital Skills Specialists Edinburgh Award is designed to help students develop and showcase their digital skills while making a real impact. Running from October to March, the program guides participants through identifying the skills they want to improve, developing them through workshops and self-directed learning, and applying them in a practical project. Students take part in mandatory group sessions, complete 16 hours of self-directed learning, attend workshops, and carry out a project that demonstrates their new skills. Throughout the award, reflection and sharing your progress are key, helping you understand your strengths, track your growth, and confidently communicate your achievements to future employers.
